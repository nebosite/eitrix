[x] Request review: Spin,Furball (2010/ http://www.xbox-360-community-games-reviews.com/contact-us/#clean_contact


I've recently published a couple of indie games and would like to kindly request a review.   I am including some descriptions and free codes for the games.

Furball - This is a first-of-its-kind game on the XBox.   A silly, fast-paced party shooter that supports up to *16 people* on a single Xbox.    Really.   This is NOT a networked game.   All sixteen players play on the *same* xbox, 4 people to a controller.   Throw in some silly graphics and sounds, and this game is a crowd-pleaser at a big party where all those 4-player games fall short.  

Purchase code for Furball:


Spin – This is a classic arcade style space shooter.  Fast paced noisy powerup action and a big space to fly around in make this game fun to explore and easy to get in to.

Purchase code for Spin:
