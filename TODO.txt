Zhilyaev Notes
    [ ] Networked Eittris - 
        - THis is slow: stupid send from server to client new position of figure, and from client to server – pressed buttons. 
        - THis is faster, doesn't work so well at very high speeds: 
            - look on client if new position of figure is acceptable.
            - If test passed send it to server. 
            - Server compare new and previous figure position. 
            - If this change real and no interference, I save it. 
            - Server and client move down figure automatically with current game speed.
            - If difference in client and server no more than 1 level – client wins, otherwise – server.
            - If there is a conflict, server wins.
        - if one of players disconnected in case of network problems, computer continue play instead of him with average player speed. Player can reconnect and intercept control.
